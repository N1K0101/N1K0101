##### About Me
*Biochemist turned genomic analyst with a passion for programming. As a skilled **Genomic Analyst**ðŸ§¬, I have experience in curating variants and prioritizing them for exome and genome sequencing. I am currently expanding my skillset by learning Python and JavaScript, and enjoy working on programming projects in my free time. With my unique background in biology and programming, I am excited to contribute to the intersection of technology and science. When I'm not analyzing genomic data or coding, you can find me playing golf* â›³
